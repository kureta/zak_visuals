- [ ] Rename all the things!
- [x] We will need multi-input processor nodes.
- [x] Interpolated noise (animation parameters) generation into its own process
- [x] Do ImageFX in cupy.
- [x] Animate latent space exploration in BigGAN
  - [x] Create a single latent vector.
  - [x] When an animation is triggered, create a second latent vector,
  - [x] interpolate between these two vectors, when animation reaches its final frame, stop.
  - [x] Put final frame into the first frame.
  - [x] Do the same for labels.
- [x] Create OSCClient for relaying unhandled messages to Onur
- [ ] Use random convolutions effect
- [x] discard dc offset and sum gorups of 8 to reduce stft dimension from 1025 to 128
- [x] calculate rms
- [x] calculate mean and std for stft
- [ ] control brightness
- [ ] add shaders
- [ ] add neural style
- [ ] add transition
- [x] cycle through labels in current group
- [x] provide current label feedback
- [x] mixer onur touchosc interface
- [x] self monitor second window
- [x] add pause/continue functionality
- [ ] label TouchOSC interface elements
- [ ] berlin sampling radius is too large
- [ ] curate label lists
- [ ] smooth low frame rate
